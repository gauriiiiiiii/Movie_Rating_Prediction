# Movie_Rating_Prediction
🎬 Movie Rating Prediction | Machine Learning Project Predict IMDb movie ratings using machine learning algorithms on real-world movie metadata.  🔍 This project leverages the IMDb dataset (IMDb.csv) to build and evaluate regression models that predict movie ratings based on features such as genre, director, runtime, votes, metascore, and more. 
🚀 Project Highlights:
📂 Dataset: Cleaned and analyzed IMDb.csv, containing movie details like title, genre, year, rating, etc.

🧼 Preprocessing:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

📈 Best Model Selection based on performance metrics

🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

✅ Outcome:
Achieved a reliable prediction model capable of estimating IMDb ratings based on a movie's metadata, with strong performance and low error margins — making it useful for recommendation systems, trend forecasting, or movie success prediction.

💡 Future Scope:
Include NLP-based sentiment analysis on user reviews.

Use deep learning models for higher predictive power.
